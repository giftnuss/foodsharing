# Icons

For including icons in the website we do not create a lot of them ourself but use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
In order to use an icon, use the code proposed by Font Awesome. For example it looks like
```
<i class="fas fa-user" />
```
in html code like .vue-js files.
That explains where this unexplained `class="fas/r/b` code comes from.
